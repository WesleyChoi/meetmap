Same Home, Different Hacks 2020

Hey! Thanks for checking out meetmap. 

With quarantine keeping many people at home, it's sometimes important to catch some fresh air and go for a walk, enjoy the outdoors, and soak up the sunshine. This being the case, how would one know whether a park is busy or not?

Users can enter a location and toggle a heatmap to determine how busy a park is, and judge whether it is safe or not to go to a park. 

meetmap was made using the Google Maps API from the Google Cloud platform.
